                <h2>Dataset Description</h2>
                <p>We began by brainstorming ideas for topics and themes that we wanted to explore further in this project. We agreed to focus on data related to the cultural heritage sector, since we all had a common interest in that field. After some discussion, we decided to delve into the world of <a href="https://www.moma.org/"target="_blank">MoMA</a> (The Museum of Modern Art, New York), and found an <a href="https://github.com/MuseumofModernArt/collection/blob/main/Artists.csv"target="_blank">interesting dataset</a> in their GitHub collection repository, containing data of all the artists represented at the museum. </p>
                <p>Our initial aim was to investigate the artists’ backgrounds to identify potential biases hidden in the data – for instance, regarding the representation of people of colour in the collection. However, we soon realised that this type of data was not available in the dataset. Consequently, we chose to focus instead on the gender aspect, examining the distribution of male and female artists in MoMA’s collection.</p>
                <p>The dataset included information on approximately 15,000 artists, so we needed to narrow the scope to a more specific subset. The brainstorming process was iterative: initially, we considered analysing gender representation across a particular time period; later, we discussed focusing on artists from our respective home countries (i.e. the Czech Republic, Sweden, and Greece). Since the numbers of artists from the three countries differed greatly, we ultimately decided to examine gender representation among the Swedish artists only. </p>
                <p>Our goal was to create an algorithm capable of counting male and female genders, calculating the totals, and saving the summary in a new file. The dataset we found was already well-formatted as a CSV file. We curated it for our algorithmic purposes by filtering the data to include only Swedish artists and retaining only the necessary variables – namely nationality and gender.</p>
                <p>To make the dataset a bit more interesting and interpretable for humans, we also kept the columns with data regarding the names of the artists, birth and death dates, and Constituent ID. We also cleaned the dataset from rows containing gaps in the “gender” field. We then validated the dataset by opening it in Excel to ensure that the CSV file was properly visualised. After cleaning, curating and validating the dataset, we proceeded to design the algorithm that could process the data. </p>
                <p>This process of work was also iterative. After designing the initial algorithm, we decided to include the rows with the missing gender values as well, to highlight the voids in the dataset. Consequently, we expanded the original dataset to include the "unknown" gender category, representing artists whose gender was not specified, and then expanded the algorithm to account for this additional variable accordingly.</p>
