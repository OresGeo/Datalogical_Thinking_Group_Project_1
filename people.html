        <h2>The Contributors</h2>
        <p><strong>Dana Neumannová</strong> has a background in library science. She previously worked as a school, college and university librarian.
            She is currently working for the Scottish Library and Information Council in Glasgow, Scotland.
            For this project, she contributed to the algorithm with the PRINT command and to the website with the navigation bar, the header and the "People" page.

         <p><strong>Isabelle Brandt</strong> (please add bio).
            She designed the majority of the algorithm's pseudocode and developed its core strucutre and logic. She created the content for the "Algorithm" page, as well as the visual model illustrating the algorithm.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Julia Milder</strong> (please add bio). She expanded the original dataset and algorithm to include the "unknown" gender, which represents the people who weren't assigned a gender in our dataset. She created the content for the "Dataset" page and updated the footer and the navigation bar on the website.     
        </p>
        <p><strong>Orestis Georgalas</strong> (please add bio). For this project, he came up with the idea for the dataset and created the foundational HTML and CSS for the website, structured all website pages, as well as the header and the footer.
            He also created the Github repository for the project.
