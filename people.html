                    <h2>The Contributors</h2>
                    <p><strong>Dana Neumannová</strong> has a background in library science. She previously worked as a school, college and university librarian.
                    She is currently working for the Scottish Library and Information Council in Glasgow, Scotland.
                    For this project, she contributed to the algorithm with the PRINT command and to the website with the navigation bar, the header and the "People" and "Home" pages.</p>
                    <p><strong>Isabelle Brandt</strong> has a background in communication science, currently living in Sweden and serving as Brand Manager at the worlds largest tea company, Lipton Tea & Infusion. For this project, she designed the majority of the algorithm's pseudocode and developed its core structure and logic. She created the content for the "Algorithm" page, as well as the visual model illustrating the algorithm.</p>
                    <p><strong>Julia Milder</strong> has a background in journalism and communication. During the last years she has worked with national tasks regarding open science at the National Library of Sweden and Stockholm University, where she has her current position. She expanded the original dataset and algorithm to include the "unknown" gender, created the content for the "Dataset" page and added to the design of the website through CSS, for example by adding columns, redesigning the footer, adding images and updating the display of different text formats.</p>
                    <p><strong>Orestis Georgalas</strong> has a background in international relations, history, and digital humanities. He is currently working as an academic editor/proofreader and as a documentation specialist in the cultural heritage sector.
