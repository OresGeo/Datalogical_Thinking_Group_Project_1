ALGORITHM: Analyze Gender Distribution of Swedish Artists from the MoMA Dataset

SET input_file = "swedish_artists.csv"
SET output_file = "gender_summary_swedish_artists.csv"

INITIALIZE female_count = 0
INITIALIZE male_count = 0
INITIALIZE unknown_count = 0

OPEN input_file
READ all rows from the file

FOR each row IN file DO
    SET gender = value of column "Gender"
    IF gender = "Female" THEN

SET female_percent = (female_count / total) * 100
SET male_percent = (male_count / total) * 100

CREATE a new data structure called summary_table
ADD ("Female", female_count, female_percent) TO summary_table
ADD ("Male", male_count, male_percent) TO summary_table
ADD ("Unknown", unknown_count, unknown_percent) TO summary_table


OPEN output_file FOR writing
WRITE headers "Gender, Count, Percent"

FOR each record IN summary_table DO
    WRITE record TO output_file
