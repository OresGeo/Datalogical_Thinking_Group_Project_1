            <h2>Introduction to the MoMA Dataset Project</h2>
            <p> We have decided to use the artists dataset from the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) repository for our project
            to reflect our shared interest in the cultural heritage sector. We found several datasets in MoMA’s GitHub
            repository and selected the artists dataset, as it sparked our interest in exploring possible bias or
            underrepresentation. After discussing several ideas, we chose to analyse the gender representation of
            Swedish artists in the museum’s collection. The artists dataset was originally a large dataset that we
            curated to suit our needs.</p>
            <p>We used pseudocode to design an algorithm that counts the number of female artists, male artists, and artists of unknown gender,
            and calculates the percentage for each category. The results were displayed in a summary table, which was
            saved in a new file. The last part of the pseudocode shows the overall findings.</p>
            <p>The algorithm revealed that there are more Swedish male artists in the MoMA collection than Swedish female or
            unknown artists. Female artists are the least represented, with only 18% of all Swedish artists in the
            collection identified as female.</p>
            <p>This website was created through the collaboration of all project group members. We organised several Zoom
            meetings to discuss ideas and allocate tasks, then worked individually using commits in our GitHub
            repository. You can read more about the structure of our website below.</p>
            <h2>Structure of the MoMA Project Website</h2>
            <p>The <a href="https://oresgeo.github.io/Datalogical_Thinking_Group_Project_1/dataset.html" target="_blank">Dataset</a> page
            features information on the dataset we decided to use for this project, as well as a sample of the dataset.
            It describes our process, from selecting the dataset and refining its scope to cleaning and curating the
            data for algorithmic analysis.</p>
            <p>The <a href="https://oresgeo.github.io/Datalogical_Thinking_Group_Project_1/algorithm.html" target="_blank">Algorithm</a>
            page explains how we designed an algorithm to analyse the gender distribution of Swedish artists in the MoMA
            collection. It outlines the key steps involved in creating the algorithm and our reasons for using
            pseudocode.</p>
            <p>The <a href="https://oresgeo.github.io/Datalogical_Thinking_Group_Project_1/people.html" target="_blank">People</a> page
            includes short biographies of each group member and the ways they contributed to the MoMA Dataset Project.</p>
            <p>Some pages also include paintings by Swedish artists from our dataset.</p>
