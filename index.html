            <h2>Introduction to the MoMA Dataset Project</h2> <!-- Subheading for the introduction section -->
            <p> Here we will write our introduction. We could also include our motivation here? (motivation must include info on conceptualisation of algorithm and dataset)
            </p>
            <h2>Structure of the MoMA Project Website</h2>
            <p>
                The <a href="https://oresgeo.github.io/Datalogical_Thinking_Group_Project_1/dataset.html">Dataset</a> page features information on the dataset we decided to use for this project as well as a sample of the dataset.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <a href="https://oresgeo.github.io/Datalogical_Thinking_Group_Project_1/algorithm.html">Algorithm</a> page explains how we designed an algorithm to analyse the gender distribution of Swedish artists in the MoMA collection. It outlines the key steps involved in creating the algorithm and our reasons for using pseudocode.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <a href="https://oresgeo.github.io/Datalogical_Thinking_Group_Project_1/people.html">People</a> page includes short biographies of each group member and the ways they contributed to the MoMA Dataset Project.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each page also includes a painting by a Swedish artist from our dataset.
