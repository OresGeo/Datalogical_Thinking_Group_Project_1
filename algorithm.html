        <h2>The Project Algorithm</h2>
        <p>
We begun the work with our algorithm by discussing what we wanted it to actually achieve, and decided the goal was to analyze the gender distribution among Swedish artists in the Museum of Modern Art collection (MoMA). We designed the algorithm to count how many of the artists in the dataset are female, male or unknown. We also designed it to calculate the percentage of each gender category. The result was written into a new CSV file with the summarized data. 

<li>After deciding on the goal and finding the purpose, we explored the dataset to understand the structure of it and which columns had useful information that we could investigate. We quickly identified gender as an key attribute and that the algorithm should read each row of that column and check it's value. From there, we made it follow the main steps which were to count males, females and unknown genders, calculate the total with a count but also percentage, and then save the summary in a new file. As a final step, the algorithm was told to print a short summary statement comparing the different count results in each category.</li>

<li>This way of designing the algorithm was chosen because it clearly demonstrates how data can be processed and summarized as an algorithm using basic operations like variables, iterations and sections. We wrote the algorithm in pseudocode to make it easier to understand with or without programming knowledge.</li>

<li>To make the coding more understandable when writing it, we created a visualized model that describes the main steps of the count and summary process.</li>
